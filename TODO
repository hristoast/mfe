TODO:

- input configuration dialog? (prolly a bit of work to implement...)
- Cheat code frontend? (probably start a seperate project...)
- i18n glade file and program strings with gettext
- add the rest of the file extensions for guessing backend type (somebody want to send me a list of common ROM extensions for the different backends?)
- better win32 support
- test on various platforms (if you run it successfully on any platform besides linux, please email me to let me know)
